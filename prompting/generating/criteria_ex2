Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the grading criteria I would suggest for the given task:

1. **User creation (1 point):** The student should be able to create a new user named "TestUser" on their Linux system. This can be verified by checking the output of the "useradd" command or by using the "id" command to confirm that the user exists.
2. **Group addition (1 point):** The student should be able to add "TestUser" to a group named "SecureGroup". This can be verified by using the "groups" command to confirm that "TestUser" is a member of "SecureGroup".
3. **Directory permissions (1 point):** The "SecureGroup" should have read and write access to all files inside the "SecureFiles" directory. This can be verified by checking the permissions of the directory using the "ls -l" command.
4. **File modification attempt (1 point):** The student should be able to log in as "TestUser" and attempt to modify "file3.txt" inside the "SecureFiles" directory. This can be verified by checking the modification timestamp of "file3.txt" before and after the attempt.
5. **Correctness of attempt (1 point):** Depending on the instructions given, the student should either be able to modify "file3.txt" (if they are supposed to test whether the permissions are too permissive) or should not be able to modify "file3.txt" (if they are supposed to test whether the permissions are secure). This can be verified by checking the permissions of "file3.txt" and ensuring that they are consistent with the intended outcome of the exercise.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
