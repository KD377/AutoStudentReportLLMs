1. User creation: 1 point - The report must demonstrate that a new user named "TestUser" was created on the Linux system. This can be verified by providing the output of the command used to create the user.
2. Group addition: 1 point - The report must show that "TestUser" was added to the group named "SecureGroup". This can be demonstrated through the output of the command used to add the user to the group.
3. Group permissions: 1 point - The "SecureGroup" must have read and write access to all files inside the "SecureFiles" directory. The report should provide the output of the command used to set the permissions and confirm that the group has the required access.
4. Successful login and modification attempt: 1 point - The report must document the attempt to log in as "TestUser" and modify "file3.txt" inside the "SecureFiles" directory. This can be demonstrated through the output of commands such as "su" or "id" to show the logged in user, and "ls -l" to show the modification of the file, if successful.
5. Unsuccessful modification: 1 point - If "TestUser" was unable to modify "file3.txt" because of the group permissions, the report must document the failed attempt. This can be demonstrated through the output of the command used to modify the file, and an explanation of the result.
