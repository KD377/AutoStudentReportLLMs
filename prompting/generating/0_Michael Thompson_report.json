            "description": "The answer clearly states the aim of the experiment and it is specific to configuring file access logging and monitoring mechanisms in Linux. It is relevant to the topic, identifies expected outcomes, demonstrates a clear connection between exercises, and appears to be feasible given the provided tasks and resources."

            "description": "The student demonstrated an understanding of file access logging and its role in recording file access events. They also explained the concept of user groups and file permissions. However, they did not explain the chmod commands used or provide a clear understanding of how the permissions of each file affect user access."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student received full points as they have correctly created the directory and files, and set appropriate permissions for each file according to the criteria."

    "Exercise_2": {
        "Grades": {
            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student correctly created a new user named 'TestUser', added 'TestUser' to the 'SecureGroup', properly configured read and write access to all files inside the 'SecureFiles' directory for the group 'SecureGroup', accurately logged in as 'TestUser', and attempted to modify 'file3.txt' inside the 'SecureFiles' directory. However, the question about how they added 'TestUser' to 'SecureGroup' was not answered, but it does not affect the points for this task."

    "Exercise_3": {
        "Grades": {
            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student demonstrated the ability to enable file access logging, created a log file, accessed 'file1.txt' from another user account, checked the log file for the recorded event, and presented the exercise in a clear and coherent manner. The answer shows a good understanding of the task."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 4,
            "description": "The student's answer clearly restates the problem and summarizes the main findings from each exercise. However, the interpretation of results and implications for future research are not explicitly stated. The answer also lacks discussion on any limitations of the study."
