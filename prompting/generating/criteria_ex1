1. Correct creation of the directory and files (1 point): The student must successfully create a new directory named "SecureFiles" in their home directory and three text files named "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt."
2. Proper use of chmod commands (1 point): The student should demonstrate the correct syntax for the chmod command, using the appropriate symbols (u, g, o) and permissions (r, w, x) for each file.
3. Appropriate permissions for file1.txt (1 point): The student will get a point if "file1.txt" has the correct permissions: readable, writable, and executable by the owner, and readable by others.
4. Appropriate permissions for file2.txt (1 point): The student will get a point if "file2.txt" has the correct permissions: readable and writable by the owner only.
5. Appropriate permissions for file3.txt (1 point): The student will get a point if "file3.txt" has the correct permissions: readable, writable, and executable by the owner and the group.

Note: The student must meet all five requirements to receive the full 5 points. If any condition is not met, they will not receive points for that item. Any partial completion or effort is not considered for awarding non-integer points.
