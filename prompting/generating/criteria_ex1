Sure, I can generate grading criteria for the given task. Here are the criteria for grading the task of exploring `chmod` commands in Linux operating systems:

1. Correct creation of the "SecureFiles" directory (1 point)
* The student should create a new directory named "SecureFiles" in their home directory.
* The "SecureFiles" directory should have the correct ownership (belonging to the student) and permissions (read, write, and execute permissions for the owner).
1. Proper creation of text files (1 point)
* The student should create three text files named "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" inside the "SecureFiles" directory.
* The text files should belong to the student and have the correct permissions (read, write, and execute permissions for "file1.txt", read and write permissions for "file2.txt", and read, write, and execute permissions for "file3.txt", for the owner only, except for "file3.txt" where the group should have the same permissions as the owner).
1. Appropriate use of chmod commands (1 point)
* The student should use the `chmod` command to set the correct permissions for each text file.
* The student should demonstrate the correct usage of `chmod` command, including the right syntax and the use of numeric mode and symbolic mode.
1. Proper documentation of commands used (1 point)
* The student should document each command used in the terminal, including the output of each command.
* The documentation should include the exact commands used and the output, allowing the grader to verify the commands' execution.
1. Verification of file permissions (1 point)
* The student should verify that the file permissions are set correctly for each text file.
* The verification can be done using the `ls -l` command or other appropriate commands to display the permissions.

By fulfilling all five requirements, the student can get the maximum number of points for this exercise, which is 5. Each requirement fulfillment can be only graded with 0 or 1 point.
