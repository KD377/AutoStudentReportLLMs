            "description": "The student correctly created a new user named 'TestUser' and added it to the 'SecureGroup'. They also configured read and write access to the 'SecureFiles' directory for the group 'SecureGroup'. The student was able to log in as 'TestUser' and attempted to modify 'file3.txt' inside the 'SecureFiles' directory, but was unsuccessful due to missing execute permissions for the group on the 'SecureFiles' directory. However, this issue was acknowledged by the student and a resolution was suggested, which would have allowed 'TestUser' to modify 'file3.txt'."

They interpreted the results and identified potential security risks, while also suggesting areas for future research. Limitations of the study were not explicitly mentioned, but this did not significantly detract from the overall quality of the conclusion."
