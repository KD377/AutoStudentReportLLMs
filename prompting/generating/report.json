            "description": "The student demonstrated a clear understanding of file permissions and the chmod commands used to set the specified permissions for each file. They also explained the concept of user groups and file access in the context of 'SecureGroup' and 'SecureFiles' directory. However, the student did not explain file access logging and Linux system architecture."

            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student has correctly created the directory and files, used the chmod commands appropriately, and set the correct permissions for all three files according to the criteria."

            "points": 4,
            "description": "The student received full points for creating a new user, adding the user to the group, and logging in as the new user. However, the student only received partial credit for configuring file access because the execute permission was missing for the 'SecureFiles' directory. Although the student identified the issue correctly, they only partially solved it by granting read and write permissions to the directory, but not the execute permission."

            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student demonstrated the ability to enable file access logging for the specified directory, created a log file to record all file access events, accessed 'file1.txt' from another user account, checked the log file for the recorded event, and provided a clear and coherent explanation for their process."

The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the importance of file access control in Linux."
