However, they did not explain the usage of chmod commands used to set the specified permissions (0 point), or provide a clear explanation of Linux system architecture (0 point)."

            "description": "The student received full credit for creating a new user, adding them to the group, and attempting to modify a file. However, they did not explicitly demonstrate granting execute permissions to the SecureFiles directory for the group, which would have fulfilled all criteria."

The answer is well-organized, easy to understand, and free from grammatical errors."

They also mentioned limitations and suggested areas for future research. However, the description could be more specific and detailed."
