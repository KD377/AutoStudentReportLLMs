The report aims to investigate the practical implications of configuring file access logging and monitoring mechanisms within a Linux system, addressing security analysis of file permissions and user access. The student demonstrated an understanding of the importance of file access logging and monitoring, but lacked the theoretical background of Linux file permissions, chmod commands, and user groups. The student successfully executed most of the exercises, but missed the execute permission for the group in Exercise 2. The student provided clear instructions on enabling file access logging and creating a log file in Exercise 3 and included recommendations for improvement. The conclusion is a strong end to the report, summarizing the findings and providing concrete recommendations.
