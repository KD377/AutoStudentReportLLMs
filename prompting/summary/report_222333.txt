The student's report aimed to explain the importance of file access logging and monitoring in Linux systems and implemented proactive security measures on a Linux system. The student demonstrated a clear understanding of file access logging but lacked explanations of file permissions, chmod commands, user groups, and their implementation. The student successfully created a secure directory, set appropriate permissions, created a new user and group, enabled file access logging, and identified recorded events in the log file. The report concluded by summarizing the key findings, evaluating the results, discussing the implications for security, and emphasizing the importance of implementing file access logging in Linux systems. However, the student lost a point for not explaining the results of their attempt to modify the file and was unable to add the new user to the SecureGroup.
