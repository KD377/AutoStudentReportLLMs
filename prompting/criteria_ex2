Sure, I can generate grading criteria based on the task provided. Here's an example:

Report Title: Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Task: Implement and compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest) for breast cancer diagnosis using a publicly available dataset.

Grading Criteria:

1. Data Preparation (1 point)
	* The dataset is properly prepared, cleaned, and preprocessed, including data splitting into train and test sets.
	* Any missing or inconsistent data is addressed and explained.
2. Algorithm Implementation (1 point)
	* The three machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest) are implemented and described in the report.
	* Proper evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to compare the performance of the algorithms.
3. Experimental Setup (1 point)
	* The experimental setup is thoroughly described, including the choice of evaluation metrics, cross-validation method, and hyperparameter tuning.
	* Any necessary assumptions or limitations are explained.
4. Results Analysis (1 point)
	* The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, including tables or figures to visualize the performance of the algorithms.
	* The results are analyzed and interpreted, and the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm are discussed.
5. Conclusion and Future Work (1 point)
	* The report concludes with a summary of the main findings and insights.
	* Future work and potential improvements are discussed.

Note: These are general grading criteria and can be modified based on the specific requirements of the assignment.
