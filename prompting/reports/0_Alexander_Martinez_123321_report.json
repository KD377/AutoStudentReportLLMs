            "description": "The answer clearly states the aim of the experiment and the objectives, such as exploring chmod commands, working with user groups and file access, and enabling file access logging. The scenarios, commands, and expected outcomes are mentioned, and the significance and relevance to security analysis are explained. However, proper scenario descriptions could be more detailed and specific."

            "description": "The student demonstrated a clear understanding of the chmod command, file permission levels, user groups, and file access logging. However, they did not provide practical examples as promised and did not demonstrate how to add a user to a group or how to enable file access logging for a directory and view the log file."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 2,
            "description": "The student was able to create the directory and text files as required. However, only the permissions for 'file1.txt' were set correctly, while 'file2.txt' and 'file3.txt' have incorrect permissions, resulting in 2 out of 5 points."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 3,
            "description": "The student received full points for user creation, group creation and addition, and explanation of results. However, they only received partial points for directory permissions because they used an incorrect command, and no points for file modification attempt because no modification timestamp was checked."

    "Exercise_3": {
        "Grades": {
            "points": 3,
            "description": "The student was able to create a log file and access 'file1.txt' from another user account, but used an incorrect command to enable file access logging. The command used to view the log file directly without proper permissions is also incorrect. The student demonstrated the ability to switch to another user account and access the file from that account, as well as create a log file. However, the incorrect commands used for enabling file access logging, setting log file permissions, and viewing the log file result in partial points."
