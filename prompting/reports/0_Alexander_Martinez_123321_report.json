        "Grades": {
            "points": 3,
            "description": "The student was able to create the SecureFiles directory and the text files. However, there were errors in setting the permissions for all three files. The student's provided chmod commands in the second question are correct, but they did not use them in the initial response. Therefore, only the points for creating the directory and files are awarded, totaling 3 points."

    "Exercise_2": {
        "Grades": {
            "points": 6,
            "description": "The student received points for creating a new user, adding the user to a group, and attempting to log in and modify a file. However, they lost points because they used an incorrect command for setting group permissions, which resulted in removing all group permissions instead of granting read and write access. The student correctly identified the issue with the write permissions for the group and provided the correct command to fix it."

    "Exercise_3": {
        "Grades": {
            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student provided clear instructions for enabling file access logging for the SecureFiles directory and creating a log file to record all file access events. The log file was configured to record read, write, and execute permissions. The student accessed file1.txt from another user account and verified that the event was recorded in the log file. A basic analysis of the log file was provided, along with recommendations for improving the logging and monitoring of file access in the SecureFiles directory. However, there were some minor issues with the commands used, such as the incorrect option 'rwx' for file access logging and setting read-only permissions for all users on the log file."
