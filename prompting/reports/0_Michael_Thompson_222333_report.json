The answer is relevant to the exercises, provides a deep explanation of the concept, uses examples, and is correct. However, there is no explicit connection made between the theoretical background and the exercises, hence only 4 points out of 5 for the criterion 'Relevance to Exercises'."

However, the student did not explain the results of their attempt to modify the file. The student was unable to modify the file because the group write permission was not set on the file itself, only on the directory."
