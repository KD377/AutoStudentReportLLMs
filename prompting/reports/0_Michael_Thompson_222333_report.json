            "description": "The student demonstrated a clear understanding of file access logging and its importance in Linux systems. However, they did not explain file permissions, chmod commands, user groups, or their implementation. They only touched on the topic of logging and monitoring."

            "description": "The student was able to create a new user and group, and set the appropriate permissions for the SecureFiles directory. However, the student lost 1 point for not explaining the results of their attempt to modify the file. The student was also unable to add TestUser to SecureGroup as shown in their question."

            "description": "The student successfully enabled file access logging for the 'SecureFiles' directory, created a log file, accessed 'file1.txt' from another user account, identified the recorded event in the log file, and reviewed the log file, confirming the correspondence between the recorded event and the actual file access."

The answer clearly states the purpose of the report, summarizes the key findings, evaluates the results, discusses the implications for security, and provides a concluding remark. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of implementing file access logging as a proactive security measure in a Linux system."
