            "description": "The answer is clear, specific, and provides a good description of the scenario and expected outcomes. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the commands and tools required for each exercise and explains the significance and relevance of the experiments to the overall topic of security analysis of file permissions and user access in Linux operating systems."

            "description": "The student demonstrated a clear understanding of the chmod command, file permission levels, and user groups. They also explained the importance of file access logging and demonstrated how to enable file access logging and view the log file. However, the student did not explain how to set file permissions for a group or provide a specific example of adding a user to a group."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student set the file permissions correctly for all three files and verified them using the `ls -l` command. The specified permissions for each file match the required access for the owner, group, and others."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 4,
            "description": "Student received full points for user creation, group creation and addition, and directory permissions. However, they only received partial credit (0.5 points) for file modification attempt and explanation of results as they did not fully explain why 'TestUser' was unable to modify 'file3.txt' and what permissions were missing."
