            "description": "The answer clearly states the aim of the experiment, which is to investigate the practical implications of configuring file access logging and monitoring mechanisms within a Linux system. The aim is directly related to the report title, addresses security analysis of file permissions and user access in Linux operating systems. The scenario selection is accurate and specific. The aim is also feasible as it is achievable within the constraints of the exercise and the Linux system, and not overly complex or unrealistic."

            "description": "The student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the importance of file access logging and monitoring in Linux systems. They explain the concept of logging and monitoring, and how it can be used for security analysis. However, the answer lacks the explanation of the theoretical background of Linux file permissions, chmod commands, and user groups which are relevant to the exercises, resulting in a loss of 1 point."

        "Grades": {
            "points": 7,
            "description": "The student created a new user 'TestUser' and added it to the 'SecureGroup' successfully. However, the group permissions on the 'SecureFiles' directory were set to 660, which only allows the owner and group members to read and write files, not execute them. The student was able to log in as 'TestUser' and attempt to modify 'file3.txt', but failed because of the missing execute permission for the group. The criteria required read and write access for the group, but it seems that the student misunderstood it as read, write, and execute permissions."

            "points": 5,
            "description": "The student provided clear instructions on enabling file access logging and creating a log file. They properly configured the log file to record all file access events including read, write, and execute permissions, verified the log file by accessing 'file1.txt' from another user account, and provided an analysis of the log file. Recommendations for improvement were also included in the answer."
