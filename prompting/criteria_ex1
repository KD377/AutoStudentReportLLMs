Sure, here are the grading criteria for the given task:

1. Correct creation of the directory and text files (1 point)
The student should be able to create a new directory called "SecureFiles" in their home directory and three text files "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" inside the "SecureFiles" directory.
2. Appropriate file permissions (2 points)
* "file1.txt" should have the correct permissions: readable, writable, and executable by the owner (444 in octal notation) and readable by others (4 in octal notation), resulting in a permission code of 444 for the owner and 4 for others.
* "file2.txt" should have the correct permissions: readable and writable by the owner only (644 in octal notation), resulting in a permission code of 644.
* "file3.txt" should have the correct permissions: readable, writable, and executable by the owner and the group (770 in octal notation), resulting in a permission code of 770.
3. Accurate chmod commands (1 point)
The student should be able to list the chmod commands used for each file. For example, `chmod 444 file1.txt`, `chmod 644 file2.txt`, `chmod 770 file3.txt`.
4. Explanation of the effects of file permissions (1 point)
The student should explain how the specified permissions affect the access to the files. Here are possible explanations:
* "file1.txt": The owner can read, write, and execute the file, and other users can only read the file.
* "file2.txt": The owner can read and write the file, but other users cannot access the file.
* "file3.txt": The owner and the group can read, write, and execute the file. Other users cannot access the file.
